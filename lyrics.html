            How could you leave us so unexpected?
            We waited, we waited
            For you but you just left us
            We needed you, I needed you

            Yo, I don't know what it's like to be addicted to pills
            But I do know what it's like to be a witness, it kills
            Mama told me she love me, I'm thinking this isn't real
            I think of you when I get a whiff of that cigarette smell, yeah

            Welcome to the bottom of hell
            They say pain is a prison, let me out of my cell
            You say you proud of me, but you don't know me that well
            Sit in my room, tears running down my face and I yell
            Into my pillowcases, say you coming to get us
            Then call a minute later just to tell us you not, I'm humiliated
            I'm in a room with a parent that I barely know
            Some lady in the corner watching us, while she taking notes

            I don't get it mom, don't you want to watch your babies grow?
            I guess pills are more important, all you have to say is "no"
            But you won't do it, will you? You gon' keep popping 'til those pills kill you
            I know you gone but I can still feel you

            Why would you leave us?
            Why would you leave us?
            How could you leave us here?
            How could you leave us?
            Why would you leave us? Oh
            Hey

            I got this picture in my room and it kills me
            But I don't need a picture of my mom, I need the real thing
            Now a relationship is something we won't ever have
            Why do I feel like I lost something that I never had?
            You shoulda been there when I graduated
            Told me you love me and congratulations
            Instead you left us at the window waiting
            Where you at mom? We're too young to understand, where you at huh?

            Yeah, I know them drugs got you held captive
            I can see it in your eyes, they got your mind captured
            Some say it's fun to get the high but I am not laughing
            And what you don't realise and what you not grasping
            That I was nothing but a kid who couldn't understand
            I ain't gon' say that I forgive you 'cause it hasn't happened
            I thought that maybe I feel better as time passes
            If you really cared for me, then where you at then?

            Why would you leave us?
            Why would you leave us?
            How could you leave us here?
            How would you leave us?
            Why would you leave us? Oh
            Hey

            Our last conversation, you and I sat in the living room
            Talking 'bout my music and I brought you something to listen to
            You started crying, telling me this isn't you
            A couple weeks later, guess you were singing a different tune
            You took them pills for the last time, didn't you?
            They took you from us once, guess they came back to finish you
            Crying my eyes out in the studio is difficult
            Music is the only place that I can go to speak to you

            It took me everything inside of me to not scream at your funeral
            Sitting in my chair, that person talking was pitiful
            I wish you were here mama but every time I picture you
            All I feel is pain, I hate the way I remember you

            They found you on the floor, I could tell that you felt hollow
            Gave everything you had plus your life to them pill bottles
            You gave everything you had plus your life to them pill bottles
            Don't know if you hear me or not, but if you still watching, why?

            Why would you leave us?
            Why would you leave us?
            How could you leave us here?
            How would you leave us?
            Why would you leave us? Oh
            Hey

            Sometimes I think about like
            Sometimes I think about things like, you know
            When I have kids, I'm like

            You won't be there, you know?
            You won't be there for any of that
            And I'll never get to see you again
            Sometimes I wish I would've just called you
            I wish I would've just picked up the phone, wish you were here
            I mean you should've been there for us, you should have been here
            Them pills got you, right?
            Them pills got you, right?
            I wish you were here
